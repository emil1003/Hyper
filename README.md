# EmilOS (Titanium)
The powerful ComputerCraft OS.
This is a remake of the original EmilOS (based on now deprecated EmilOS-2 alphas), using Titanium.

#Installation
If only the OS itself is wanted, then downloading and running `EmilOS.tpkg` is the only required step. The package will take care of the rest.

#Building
If you're interested in modifying and building the code yourself, here's the steps:
1. Install TPM/TDT Tools by running `pastebin run 5B9k1jZg` in the computer. Follow the steps to set it up.
2. Clone the repo into your computer.
3. You're all set! To build the modified source, run `tdt build` (or `tdt run` to instantly test the build). For more info about TDT, refer to [the Titanium documentation](http://harryfelton.web44.net/titanium/guide/project-basics).
